# ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work

The [ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work](https://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm), adopted in 1998 and amended in 2022, is an expression of commitment by governments, employers' and workers' organizations to uphold basic human values - values that are vital to our social and economic lives. It affirms the obligations and commitments that are inherent in membership of the ILO, namely:

a. freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;
b. the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour;
c. the effective abolition of child labour;
d. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation; and
e. a safe and healthy working environment.

**Socketry, the open source organisation, is committed to these principles and rights.**
